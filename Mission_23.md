# Day 23

## Introduction @showdialog

Make sure Alfie is dancing around the wooden Christmas tree and flashing his lights in the darkness!

## Step 1

Ok, it's time to put the skills that you've learned to test!

## Step 2

So you need to 2 things:
- make Alfie go around Christmas tree in square
- light up Alfie's lights when it's dark

## Step 3

For the first part, micro:bit already prepared for you useful functions - check them out in ``||Mission23:Mission23||`` in your toolbox.
Remember to:
- place the instruction in ``||Loops:repeat||`` loop (for example, 4 times),
- adjust the time Alfie needs to turn to make a 90Â° right turn,
- adjust the time Alfie needs to go 30 cm straight
- stop the motors at the end

## Step 4

For the second part, insert ``||Logic:if else||`` in ``||Loops:repeat||`` loop and the following logic:
- if ``||Input:light level||`` is less than 10, flash Alfie's lights (micro:bit prepared a function for you for that too ``||Mission23:flash lights []||``).
- else, turn the lights off

## Step 5

Awesome, put it together and test it. ``|Download|`` the code and come back to the chapter!

P.S. There is extra challenge - go next if you feel adventurous!

```ghost
for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
        if (10 > input.lightLevel()) {
            maqueen.writeLED(maqueen.LED.LEDLeft, maqueen.LEDswitch.turnOn)
            maqueen.writeLED(maqueen.LED.LEDRight, maqueen.LEDswitch.turnOn)
        } else {
            maqueen.writeLED(maqueen.LED.LEDLeft, maqueen.LEDswitch.turnOff)
            maqueen.writeLED(maqueen.LED.LEDRight, maqueen.LEDswitch.turnOff)
        }
        maqueen.motorRun(maqueen.Motors.M2, maqueen.Dir.CCW, 100)
        maqueen.motorStop(maqueen.Motors.All)
        basic.pause(170)
        Mission23.goStraight(100)
        Mission23.goRight(100)
        Mission23.Flash(true)
        
    }
```

## Step 6

So micro:bit prepared quite a few functions, but can you solve the mission also without them! Try to modify your code so that everything (except the lights under Alfie) is done without using stuff from ``||Mission23:Mission23||``
